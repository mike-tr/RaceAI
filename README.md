# RaceAI

Idk what to show for seminar so i want to make a racing game where the "enemies" would be car that learned how to drive via Genetic algorithm.

- Added Matrix Class that basically allows all matrix operations needed for neural networks, i.e Multiply Matrices, multiply be scalar, add scalar, devide,
  get random matrix etc...
- Added support for applying any (doube) -> (double) function on every entry of the matrix. (i.e apply activation function).
- Built a car model, track, trees, envirment in blender and added to game.
- Added Car Scripts times etc...
- Added CarAI neuralnetwork, as well as a save/load system.


## Need to do:
- Add Sensors for AI
  - In this case simply raycast that tell the distance from "track borders" ( they are invisisble ).
- Add Genetic algorithm, and training processs.
